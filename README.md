complex network theory reveals the modular structure of diseases and their inter-relationships
Recent developments in clustering and graph theory has suggested that many human diseases or disorders 
are linked by common genetic modules through shared genes. The hypothesis that each gene has only function 
needs to be corrected since increasing evidence is suggesting that a given gene may have many roles in 
the cell. Furthermore, although faulty genes need not be directly shared between diseases they can interact 
with similar proteins in the network neighborhood. Thus, some diseases are indirectly linked and any analysis 
of disease genes must take this into account. Our system provides a statistical analysis of local and distant 
neighborhood protein interactions using complex network measures and thus builds up a more accurate model of 
diseases and their connections to other diseases.
