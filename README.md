# ComplexNetworks
## Updated 3rd February 2018

In this work we use complex network theory to provide a statistical model of the connectivity patterns of human proteins and their interaction partners. Our intention is to identify hub proteins that may be predisposed to be potential candidates as drug targets for  therapeutic interventions. Hub proteins usually have more interaction partners than non-hub proteins but there are no hard and fast rules for defining the actual number of interactions. We devise a statistical measure for identifying hub proteins,  we score our hub proteins with gene ontology annotations, the important drugable protein targets are likely to have similar biological functions that can be assessed for their potential therapeutic value. Furthermore, our system provides a statistical analysis of the local and distant neighborhood protein interactions of the discovered hubs using complex network measures and thus builds up a more accurate model of drug-to-target activity and impact on treating diseases. We integrate high quality protein-interaction data from the HINT database,  disease associated proteins from the DrugTarget database, biological knowledge from Gene Ontology and further drug information from DrugBank.
