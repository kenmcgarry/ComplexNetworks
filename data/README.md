The `HINT-2017.CSV` file is the HINT (High-quality INTeractomes) is a curated compilation of high-quality protein-protein 
interactions from 8 interactome resources (BioGRID, MINT, iRefWeb, DIP, IntAct, HPRD, MIPS and the PDB). http://hint.yulab.org/

The `drug.target.interaction.tsv.gz` data is downloaded from DrugCentral is a comprehensive drug information resource for FDA drugs and drugs approved outside USA. The resources can be searched using: drug, target, disease, pharmacologic action, terms.

The `pharos_v4.6.2.csv` is an incomplete list of protein types-according Panther categories. GPCR, TF, IC etc. https://pharos.nih.gov/idg/about

The `BioPlex.csv` adds addtional high confidence PPI interactions to our HINT data. http://bioplex.hms.harvard.edu/

Most important is the `GoSlim generic OBO` file. http://http://www.geneontology.org/page/go-subset-guide
